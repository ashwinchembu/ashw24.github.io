    info: "In this project, I developed a C++ program that utilizes a graph data structure and breadth-first search to find the shortest path between any two actors in the IMDb database. By constructing a graph of the relationships between actors based on the movies they have appeared in, the program is able to efficiently find the connection between any two actors and output the specific movies and co-actors that form the path. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a graph data structure and utilize it to solve a real-world problem, as well as my proficiency in C++ programming.",

    title: 'NQueens Without Recursion',
    info: 'In this project, I wrote a C++ program that solves the N Queens problem using a stack-based backtracking algorithm. The N Queens problem consists of placing N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other and can be represented as a search tree, with each level corresponding to a row and each child representing a possible placement. My program starts at the root of the tree and pushes nodes onto a stack as it traverses, and pops nodes off the stack when it backtracks. This project demonstrates my ability to implement a non-recursive backtracking algorithm and use it to solve a classic computer science problem.',

    title: 'Sudoku/SAT Solver',
    info: ' I wrote a Python program that uses the boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem to solve Sudoku puzzles. Given a partially filled-in grid, the goal is to fill in the remaining cells such that every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1 through 9 without repetitions. This problem can be represented as a boolean formula, where each cell corresponds to a boolean variable and the constraints are represented using logical clauses. I used the pycosat library to find a satisfying assignment and implemented a function to convert the boolean formula into conjunctive normal form using the Tseitin transformation.',
